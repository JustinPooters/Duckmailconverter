# ⚡️ DuckDuckGo mail forwarder

Welcome. In this repository you will find a simple tool that converts normal emails to a @duck.com mail.
DuckDuckGo has created an email forwarder that removes all spam and trackers. It has quite a interesting way of sending and receiving mails. 
If you receive a mail on your @duck.com mail, it forwards it using a sender_at_domain.com_yourmail@duck.com. This makes it quite hard to send mails.
This tool transforms any email to a duck email so you can use it to send emails.

## How do i use this code?!

in the .env file there is a variable: `YOUR_MAIL`. Change this to you [duck.com](https://duck.com) mail. 
After this you can run a command in the folder where you unzipped / cloned this tool. 

The convert command is:
```
node index.js email@example.com
```

Here you have to change the `email@example.com` to the mail you want to send a email to using your @duck.com email.
