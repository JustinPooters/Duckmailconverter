# ⚡️ DuckDuckGo Mail Forwarder

Greetings! Within this repository, you'll discover a straightforward tool designed to convert regular emails into @duck.com mail. DuckDuckGo has ingeniously devised an email forwarder that eliminates spam and trackers, employing a unique approach to sending and receiving mails.

When you receive an email on your @duck.com address, it is forwarded using the format sender_at_domain.com_yourmail@duck.com, adding an extra layer of complexity to sending mails. This tool simplifies the process, allowing you to transform any email into a duck email for sending purposes.

## How to Utilize the Code

In the .env file, locate the variable `YOUR_MAIL` and update it with your [duck.com](https://duck.com) mail. Afterward, execute a command in the directory where you've unzipped or cloned this tool.

The conversion command is as follows:
```
node index.js email@example.com
```

Replace `email@example.com` with the email address to which you intend to send an email using your @duck.com address.
